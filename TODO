Set up database of plants to check if user has a plant or not
start working on api.py and see how much I can reconnect to JS
Set up bits redemptions

DONE
set up all the databases:
    plants_table (this will have the data counted at end of stream when user goes off line and inputted into a stats table)
        id, broadcaster_id, plant_id (can this just be the id?) timestamp_created, placement
    victim_of_table (need to look over this and may combine with other tables)
        plant_id, plant_owner_id, attacker_id, timestamp_wilted
    successfully_wilted_table (currently this is for successful attacks that result in death of plant without any watering in between)
        attacker_id, plant_id, timestamp_wilted

should we keep a tally of who kills who how many times? - can do this with COUNT()
    have tiers for this? assasin, weedwhacker, shears, etc?
track and tally the amount of times someone places 1-3? as well as uptime of plants, how many plants they have planted, avg of how long their plants live,  how many times plant dies, avg of deaths to plants planted?, how many times they water?
    have tiers based on avgs?  Gold thumb, green thumb, brown thumb, black thumb?
what other information do we need to keep track of?
