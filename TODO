Set up database of plants to check if user has a plant or not
start working on api.py and see how much I can reconnect to JS
Set up bits redemptions

Data I want to track:
    streamer
    plant owner
    time planted
    time died
    if the attack killed the plant or by thirst
    # times watered
    # times thugged
    # times attacked

    --needs to be in different table
    who attacks who


should we keep a tally of who kills who how many times? - can do this with COUNT()
    have tiers for this? assasin, weedwhacker, shears, etc?
track and tally the amount of times someone places 1-3? as well as uptime of plants, how many plants they have planted, avg of how long their plants live,  how many times plant dies, avg of deaths to plants planted?, how many times they water?
    have tiers based on avgs?  Gold thumb, green thumb, brown thumb, black thumb?
what other information do we need to keep track of?
